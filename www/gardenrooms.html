                                We create luxury, insulated garden rooms for year-round comfort and use.

                                All our garden rooms for sale are made employing advanced SIPS (Structural Insulated panels) technology, which was first used in 1930 in the USA and became popular worldwide in 1965. Our wooden garden rooms construction consists of SIPS panels that themselves consist of two OSB sheets with insulation in between; with this “sandwich” being set in a wooden frame. Each SIPS panel is fixed to the other with a polyurethane glue, thus creating a complete, very solid, structure. Thanks to their high insulation level, reliability, building simplicity and low costs, SIPS buildings have become so popular that they account for 60% of new buildings in the UK, 70% in Scandinavian countries and 95% in Canada. As a result, in many countries, SIPS buildings are called Canadian houses.
