			<h4 class="color2 margin">From All of Us at Revenue, Inc.</h3>
			<p>Hi Z,

				From all of us at Revenue, Inc. we want to wish you Happy Birthday! We all wish you lots of success and
				happiness, good people around, and a power team and people around to take you and Revenue, Inc. to new heights.
				We wish Revenue, Inc. to grow into one of the top marketing companies in the world and one day for Forbes to list
				you ;) May your kids and family be a great source of inspiration and joy for you.
				<br><br>
				Anyone can be a boss. But not everyone can be a leader. Thank you for sharing your knowledge and experience with
				us and always motivate us to go outside of our comfort zone to achieve more. As Rosalynn Carter said: "A leader
				takes people where they want to go. A great leader takes people where they don't necessarily want to go, but
				ought to be." And we want to take this special moment to thank you for being a great leader! You motivate us and
				encourage us to be better every day.
<br><br>
				May this birthday bring great happiness to you and your family! Just remember not to work too hard today... save
				it for the rest of the year. Happy birthday!
<br><br>
				All Best,
				Your Team
<br><br>
				P.S. Apologies for making you click a couple of times, but we wanted to make this a little fun :)

			<p class="text-right">Happy Birthday!</p>
			<p class="text-right">All Best,
				Your Teamâ™¥</p>
